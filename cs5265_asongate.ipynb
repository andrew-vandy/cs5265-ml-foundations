        "\n",
        "Customer churn is a major issue eCommerce businesses face. It is defined as the percentage of customers lost over a given period of time. According to customer data at Gorgias, repeat customers account only 21% of customers, but generate 44% of revenue and 46% of orders. Therefore it has become increasingly important to identify and mitigate factors that cause customer churn.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some of the challenges in building a predictive churn model are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Lack of a \"universal methodology\": There are machine learning methods like classification that can be used which are efficient and caretorize complex data sets. Another technique is Survival Analysis, which can predict churn over a given period.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Exploratory Analysis: During the exploratory analysis phase, there could be missing information or lack of a robust attributes set.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Human Behavior: It is hard to predict human behavior. A customer may spend a lot of time browsing different products but eventually not purchasing anything. On the other hand, you might have a customer who knows exactly what they need, spending less time on the site but purchasing a lot more products.\n",
